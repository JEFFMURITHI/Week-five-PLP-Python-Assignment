📌 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class 🏗️
✅ Task

Create a class representing a real-world object (e.g., Smartphone, Book, or Superhero).

Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life.

Use constructors to initialize objects with unique values.

Add an inheritance layer to demonstrate encapsulation and polymorphism.

📂 Implementation

We created a Smartphone class and a GamingPhone subclass.

Smartphone class includes attributes: brand, model, and a private (__battery) attribute.

Methods include: call(), check_battery(), and charge().

GamingPhone inherits from Smartphone and adds attributes like gpu.

It overrides the call() method (polymorphism) and adds a new method play_game().

📌 Assignment 2: Polymorphism Challenge 🎭
✅ Task

Create multiple classes (e.g., animals or vehicles).

Each class should have the same action method (e.g., move()).

Make each class define the method differently to demonstrate polymorphism.

📂 Implementation

We created four classes: Car, Plane, Boat, and Animal.
Each class defines its own version of the move() method.
